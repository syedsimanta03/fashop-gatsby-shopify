## ðŸš€ Quick start


 **Start server.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd ./
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.
